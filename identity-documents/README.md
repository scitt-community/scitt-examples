# Identity Documents as Receipts

The simplest form of identity document is a signed public key.

- unknown.

By proving possession of a private key, where the corresponding public key is signed in an identity document,
the identity associated with the public key can be authenticated.

```mermaid
flowchart

    subgraph TA1 [Trust Anchor provided by Endorser]
        cloud_anchor_private(Private Key)
        cloud_anchor_public(Public Key)
    end

    cloud_anchor_public -- certification path 1 --> device_root_private

    subgraph TA2 [Root of Trust in Device]
        device_root_private(Private Key)
        device_root_public(Public Key)
    end

    device_root_public -- certification path 2 --> relying_party
    relying_party(Relying Party)
```

Because keys need to be rotated to comply with best practices, 
one use case for SCITT is providing key transparency regarding public keys associated with software supply chains.

```mermaid

    subgraph TA0 [Trust Anchor]
        endorser_private(Private Key)
        endorser_public(Public Key)
    end

    subgraph TA1 [Transparency Log]
        cloud_anchor_private(Private Key)
        cloud_anchor_public(Public Key)
        ledger(Ledger)
    end

    subgraph TA2 [Device]
        device_root_private(Private Key)
        device_root_public(Public Key)
    end

    subgraph Receipt
        id_public_2{{Public Key}}
    end

    subgraph TA4 [Identity Document]
        id_public{{Device Public Key}}
    end

    subgraph TA5 [Relying Party]
        authentication_policy(Authentication Policy)
    end

    endorser_public -- certification path 1 --> device_root_private

    device_root_public -- registration --> ledger
    cloud_anchor_public -- endorsement --> Receipt
    ledger -- enrollment --> Receipt
    Receipt == is an ==> TA4

    device_root_public -.-> TA4

    TA0 -- verify signature --> TA5
    TA1 -- verify signature --> TA5
    TA4 -- verify signature --> TA5

```

## Usage

You will need a CLI that can produce and consume SCITT transparent statements.
This one supports RFC9162 and json, and is ðŸš§ EXPERIMENTAL ðŸš§.

```sh
npm i -g @transmute/cli
```

Generates keys, signs them and produces receipts, roughly matching the diagrams above.

```sh
./script.sh
```

### Device Identity Document

A signed public key, with a receipt from a transparency service.

#### Protected Header

This is the protected header of the device's "Identity Document".

The device key is signed by the endorser before being made transparent.

#### Receipt

Proof that the identity document has been notarized.

#### Protected Header

This is the protected header of the receipt for the device's "Identity Document".

Here we see the binary merkle tree from RFC9162 (-111: 1) is used, 
this is paired with the proofs in the unprotected header (-222: { -1 : [ ... ] }).

This tells us that the receipt is build on the inclusion proof from RFC9162.

#### Decoded Inclusion Proof

This proves inclusion of a merkle leaf constructed as described in RFC9162,
from a detached signature over a cose key (application/cose-key)
